## Welcome to My Thought Box
**HELLO** I'm Natalie and this is a space for me to compile my thoughts and figure out how to better myself. I've never really been a writer, but I think it'll be good to have a place to compose myself and centralize everything (plus, I don't have to worry about losing a notebook).
