# Newfounded Habits
## 6AM Productivity (Day one)
I saw another blog post talk about Matt D'Avella's 30-day challenge list, and I've decided to (impulsively) attempt waking up at 6AM every morning. Today was the first day of the challenge, and it actually felt so good to wake up before the sun came up. It usually takes me an hour or so to start focusing on my work, so starting early was helpful today! I went on a spontaneous Safeway run to buy broccoli today (Hyunju inspired my to make roasted broccoli for lunch LOL). I'm hoping to do more work tomorrow before I head out during the afternoon.

## Daily Sketch
Ever since I finished up my second Etsy collection, I've run out of new ideas & this has made me lose my motivation to draw. Honestly, the timing of this art block is kind of handy since I don't have to worry about finishing up a collection by a certain time. Lately, I've been choosing to relax/spend time outside (the weather has been really nice- 84Â°F today!) over thinking of new ideas/working on unfinished drawings.

I don't want to put a complete pause on drawing, so I'm hoping to get the creative juices flowing by doing some small sketches every day.
