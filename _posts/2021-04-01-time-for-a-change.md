title: Time for a Change

Hi, I'm going to try journaling my next 30 days while I complete my early-morning-challenge to see if my productivity will increase/be affected by this new lifestyle. I might continue posting after that, but I have a tendency to get ahead of myself and plan too far into the future, so I want to take it as it comes this time. 

### Consistency
One thing I struggle with most is continuing with a habit or lifestyle. I find it easy to start new things but when something starts plateauing, I always lose motivation before I can build it into a habit. Matt D'Avella says that he abides by a "two-day rule", and I'd like to give that a try, whether it be going to live lectures or exercising. 
> Never skip the thing you're trying to accomplish more than two days in a row

By abiding to this rule, I hope to still have motivation to continue wiht a routine after slipping up. Usually, I go into a never-ending cylce of "oh, I skipped yesterday so I might as well restart next week" when I mess up.
## Random Daily Happenings
I think I'll be using this area to list out some things I've done today, no matter how productive it was. It might be cool to look back in the future:
- went to both my lectures
- played 1+ hr of ping pong with dad
- went to the second rush info night (left early because I was too hungry)

## 6AM Productivity (Day one)
I saw another blog post talk about Matt D'Avella's 30-day challenge list, and I've decided to (impulsively) attempt waking up at 6AM every morning. Today was the first day of the challenge, and it actually felt so good to wake up before the sun came up. It usually takes me an hour or so to start focusing on my work, so starting early was helpful today! I went on a spontaneous Safeway run to buy broccoli today (Hyunju inspired my to make roasted broccoli for lunch LOL). I'm hoping to do more work tomorrow before I head out during the afternoon.
## Simple Sketch
Ever since I finished up my second Etsy collection, I've run out of new ideas & this has made me lose my motivation to draw. Honestly, the timing of this art block is kind of handy since I don't have to worry about finishing up a collection by a certain time. Lately, I've been choosing to relax/spend time outside (the weather has been really nice- 84Â°F today!) over thinking of new ideas/working on unfinished drawings.

I don't want to put a complete pause on drawing, so I'm hoping to get the creative juices flowing by doing some small sketches (limiting myself to 15 mins) every day.
