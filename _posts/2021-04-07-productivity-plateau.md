I was so excited to write/jot down a small entry everyday, but almost a week in and I already want to give up. This keeps happening whenever I start something new, so I HAVE TO continue this time. I might skip a day here and there, but as long as I'm following the two-day rule, I can still take breaks from writing without feeling bad. I haven't been very focused lately, and I need to get myself together to be able to finish prep on time. I also want to be AHEAD of my schoolwork, but I've been behind since the first day of school.

I'm keep this post short because I need to ✨focus✨.

## 6:30/7AM Productivity
Dad said that he thinks I should wake up at 6:30 and get up immediately after hearing my alarm instead of setting it at 6 and mooching around for half an hour. I wasn't able to wake up on time today because I went to sleep pretty late last night (fell asleep at around 11:30ish). I think I'll try for 6:30AM tomrorow again. My productivity has been **extremely** low today and I'm not sure why. I have a lot of lectures lined up to watch & I also need to finish up debugging my code for the RSG assignment. I'm not getting distracted by my phone as much, but I'm just not motivated to watch anything even though I have a quiz later today (and I'll need to finish my IS 451 lecture by then). I skipped FIN 462 this morning (again) because I wasn't able to watch the lecture (from the last missing class on Mon) before class started.

## Simple Sketches
I drew the french press after making my first cup of coffee yesterday morning (added too much water to the mini french press though). The llama looks like a horse, but maybe I'll try drawing the same thing in a few months to see if I've improved at all.
