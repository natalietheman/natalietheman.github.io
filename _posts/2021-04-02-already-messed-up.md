## Random Daily Happenings

## 6AM Productivity
I swear I set an alarm for 6AM, but I must have either unconsciously turned it off or someone came into my room late last night to turn it off (scary!). The sky was already lightening when I woke up (around 6:53 AM) and I was so disappointed in myself. It's the SECOND day! But like I mentioned yesterday, I can't let this demotivate me, so I'm going to adhere to the two-day rule and wake up at the right time tomorrow. I got ready quicker than yesterday, but I don't think my productivity has been much higher than normal. I love the time I have to myself, but I didn't spend much time doing work so far (and it's around 8:30 AM as I'm writing this section right now). After I finish jotting this part down, I'll go and work on the RSG assignment (CS 107). 
## Simple Sketch
Okay, I also said I was going to only spend 15 minutes on a sketch, and I failed at that too. I ended up spending almost half an hour because my intial sketch (breakdown of the components inside a matcha milk drink) was extremely ugly. I switched gears and drew this sakura at the end of the first 15 minute mark. Tomorrow, I need to stop drawing immediately after the 15 minute cutoff, no matter how ugly it looks. This way, I'll be able to learn how to exert control overmyself and my distractions.
