I think I was a little thrown off by waking up late today, along with getting distracted by my afternoon plans. I felt like I was almost waiting to go out as an excuse to not do work. One of the biggest challenges I know I face is my lack of self-control. I'm constantly mindlessly scrolling through my phone as a way to procrastinate my work. When I am able to focus and think about how to work through an assignment, I "give myself a break" for getting to that point (where in reality, I've actually achieved nothing). This constant cycle of distracting myself and entering a focused mindset is wasting a lot of time. I've started using this app called Flora and I think it's very helpful when it's on, but I tend to take too long of a break in between the sessions. I need to start following the break times given to me. 

Also, I just finished up the Tom & Jerry's Topped strawberry ice cream (too sweet), so I think I'll go out to buy another tub tomorrow (the ice cream inventory is running a little low rn..)

## Random Daily Happenings
Today was a relatively unproductive day and I was feeling quite sluggish, but it was nice meeting up with Hyunju & Kylie <3
- got juice zone (passion power), kylie treated us :))
   - ate lunch at Sycamore park
   - bought cream cheese from safeway
- went on a short run
- scheduled my vaccine appointment!

## 6AM Productivity
I swear I set an alarm for 6AM, but I must have either unconsciously turned it off or someone came into my room late last night to turn it off (scary!). The sky was already lightening when I woke up (around 6:53 AM) and I was so disappointed in myself. It's the SECOND day! But like I mentioned yesterday, I can't let this demotivate me, so I'm going to adhere to the two-day rule and wake up at the right time tomorrow. I got ready quicker than yesterday, but I don't think my productivity has been much higher than normal. I love the time I have to myself, but I didn't spend much time doing work so far (and it's around 8:30 AM as I'm writing this section right now). After I finish jotting this part down, I'll go and work on the RSG assignment (CS 107). 
## Simple Sketch
Okay, I also said I was going to only spend 15 minutes on a sketch, and I failed at that too. I ended up spending almost half an hour because my intial sketch (breakdown of the components inside a matcha milk drink) was extremely ugly. I switched gears and drew this sakura at the end of the first 15 minute mark. Tomorrow, I need to stop drawing immediately after the 15 minute cutoff, no matter how ugly it looks. This way, I'll be able to learn how to exert control overmyself and my distractions.
