Oops I forgot to write a post for the past two days..
I know I mentioned how it takes me a little bit of time after I wake up to start getting into a focused mindset, but I think I'm wasting the potentially-productive hours by doing menial tasks like cleaning up the dishwasher or walking around. It's affecting my productivity negatively since I don't actually start doing work until 2ish hours after waking up (around 8AM). I'm going to write my blog post as a break from doing work from now on - it'll be a good way to take my mind off of things while still completing tasks I want to have finished by the end of the day.

I skipped my FIN 462 lecture today because I was still catching up on my compounding lectures from last week. After I watch the panopto from today's missed lecture, I'll be back on track so I can go to lecture this coming Wednesday. 

Also I'm thinking of picking up a little this quarter because I won't have time fall + I don't know what my schedule looks like next winter/spring. I'll decide after deliberations tonight & sleep on it. 

Dad saw a slickDeals coupon code for a cheap Raspberry Pi case and wanted me to try building my own Raspberry Pi. When I take a break later, I'll look into what I need to buy (I have a $100 budget) and how to build it from scratch!! *AH I really hope I don't forget*

## 6AM Productivity
I've been sleeping too late to wake up at 6. I think I need to sleep by 10:30 LATEST (to give myself a little buffer to wind down in bed). I should get rid of my habit of staying on my phone once I get into bed (unless it's a conversation..should be more lenient with that). Scrolling mindlessly on social media watching videos and posts that make it so hard to wake up the next morning isn't worth it. I woke up at 6 to snooze my alarm until 6:30ish (half-asleep). I ended up just turning my alarm clock off and woke up at 7:15AM. Weirdly, I was more productive this morning because I felt so bad for waking up late and having less time than usual. If I'd woken up on time, I would've finished catching up on missed lectures and I wouldn't be missing class again :'). I'm also kind of worried that if I go to pship events, I'll have to sleep REALLY late and this will mess up my sleep schedule again..but I'll worry about that later :)
## Simple Sketch
I forgot to sketch yesterday/today in the morning, so here's a picture of the bagel I drew on Saturday:
(this is what I had for breakfast on Saturday!)
